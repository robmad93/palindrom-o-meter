# palindrom-o-meter
My attempt for the first certification project of the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. In this project, I created a simple palindrome checker. As this was a certification project, no code was provided in advance. Therefore, I wrote all code in the files, with help from various resources when required.
